What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a collection of values. The values can have relationships among them, and they can have functions
apply to them. Each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for. The most important thing to take
away is that each data structure is good and is specialized for its own thing.

You can think of data structures as any sort of compartment or container. A data structure is simply a file cabinet of
different types. You have a backpack, a place where you put your school books, you have drawers where you put your
clothes, a fridge where you put your food, a folder for your files and a packing box for your toys. Each one of these
containers are useful for its own thing. I'm not going to put my food in a drawer, because that Yogurt is going to go
bad there. Likewise, I'm not going to put my papers and files in my backpack, or a toy box because it's just going to
get crumpled up.

Each one of these containers are specific for its own thing, and that's whay data structure really is. It's a way for
us to organize data so taht we can go into the backpack and retrieve that data really easily. We can go into the
fridge and grab that popsicle or ice cream really fast.

We have a ton of different data structures as you can see in the following link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

You may have even heard of Bitcoin and how it uses blockchain technology, this magical word. Well, blockchain at the
end of the day is simply a data structure, a way to hold information.

But remember... There are ALWAYS trades offs.

Remember when we talked about the 3 pillars of programming? Readability, Memory and Speed.
We have the same thing with data structures. One is better than the other in some aspects, and the other better than
the other. Each one for its own speficic case.

1. How to Build One
2. How to Use it

How to Build One: how can we build with code some of these data strucutres?
How to use it: how to use these data structures?

We're going to do both. But the second point is the most important, because data strcutures are usually just tools. And
most of the time they're already pre-built for us.

The most important part is how to use them, when to use one over the other. We kind of saw a little bit of that in the
"How to Solve Coding Problems" section, where we used an object versus an array to make our code more efficient.

The goal is to understand data structure so that you can pick the right data structure for your problem.

Based on different scenarios, data needs to be stored in a specific format. We have a handful of data structures that
cover our need to store data in different formats.
