What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?

Because as we learned in our previous lectures, data structures are simply ways to organize our data on our computers.
And the data structures we'll see throughout this course are simply variations of how we store this data on our
computers.

And each data structure has their trade offs. Some are good at certain operations, others are good at other operations.
One type of action that we're going to perform with data structures is insertion. Add a new data item in a given
collection of items such as adding the "Apple" item into a fruit basket array.

Another one, is deletion. We want to sometimes delete data such as remove "Mango" from our list.

Another type of action might be traversal, and we're going to see this a lot. Traversal simply means to access each data
item exactly once so that it can be processed.

Another useful one is searching. We want to find out the location of the data item if it exists in a given collection.

And we also have things like sorting.

And obviously the main one and probably the most important is access. How do we access this data that we have on our
computer? Now, each data structure that we're going to go through in this course, we'll have different pros and cons for
each one of these.

If we take a look at out Big O cheatsheet, we will see a section called "Common Data Structure Operations". But don't
get overwhelmed, we are going to go over most of these data structures, and we'll that half of them are mainly trees and
variation of trees.
