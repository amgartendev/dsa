"""
Each language has their own data types or built in data types. Python, for example, has integers, floats, strings,
booleans, and many others.

And each language has a data structures to organize these data types. So for example, in Python we have arrays and
objects that we use, and they are data types. It allows us to structure and organize information such as our primitive
data types or even hold more complex ones, like having an arrat that contains multiple objects.

Although these languages come with data structures built in, we can also build our own. And most languages have enough
data structures and data types for us to build and create our own data structures.

So for example, if Python doesn't have stacks, we can build one.
