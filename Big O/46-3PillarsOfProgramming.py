"""
Let's go back on that question "What is good code?"

Well, we've already seen that a good code is a code that is readable and scalable. But, when we are talking about
scalable code, we have two very important thing

- What is good code? -
1. Readable
2. Scalable
    2.1 -> Speed
    2.2 -> Memory


Speed: That's what we've been talking about up until now. How fast is our runtime on the code? How much time does it
take for a function to run? How many operations does it cost?

Memory: Computers have limited memory. Back in the day when computers were just being born, memory was very, very
expensive. We only had a litte bit of it. And as time has gone on, we have more and more memory. But it's not infinite.
Our computers run based on speed, which is usually dictated by the CPU and memory based on how much memory such as RAM
(Random Access Memory) the computer has.

Memory is very simple, not as complicated as speed. And it won't take us long to learn as much as we have about speed.


- Which code is best? -
This can be answered with 3 pillars of code. Something that I want you to take with you for the rest of your career,
and something that is going to grow you as an engineer. Because from now on, when you write code, you're going to have
these three things in mind.

1. Readable: you're going to write readable code, clean code that others can read that is maintainable.
2. Speed: the type of code that we call time complexity. It has a Big O time complexity that is efficient. It scales
well.
3. Memory: what is the memory usage of your code? If it uses a lot of memory, that's not good. We might have limited
memory on our machine. With this one, we use Big O once again to talk about space complexity, the same notation but
different topic.

Most programming code solution, there's usually a trade off between speed and memory. You want things to go faster?
Well, then you might have to sacrifice more memory. You want less memory? Well, then you might have to sacrifice with
increased speed.
