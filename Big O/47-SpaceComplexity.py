"""
When a program executes, it has two ways to remember things. The heap and the stack.

The heap is usually where we store variables that we assign values to, and the stack is usually where we keep track of
our function calls.

Sometimes we want to optimize for using less memory instead of using less time. Talking about memory or space complexity
is very similar to talking about the time cost. We simply look at the total size relative to the size of the input and
see how many new variables or new memory we're allocating, how much memory is being used.
