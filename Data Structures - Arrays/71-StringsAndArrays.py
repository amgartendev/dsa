"""
This file is just to let you know about a common interview trick. We're going to be doing some arrays questions after
this.

In interviews, you should treat any string questions like array. Strings arre simply array of characters. Most of the
time in an interview when you get a question like "Reverse a String", what you should be thinking is to convert this
into an array, do some sort of loop on it or an operation using something like a split method in Python, and then
returning it as a string after you've finished the operations with them.
