These exercises are completely optional if you want to practice more interview questions related to Arrays.
You can also come back to these once you have finished the course. I recommend you watch the video titled
"How To Use Leetcode" in the Bonus section of the course at the very end to see how you can do these problems and see
solutions in any language that you chose.

1. Two Sum -> https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/
2. Maximum Subarray -> https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/
3. Move Zeroes -> https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/
4. Contains Duplicate -> https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/
5. Rotate Array -> https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/

Bonus:
This question is the type of problems that can be done using what we know about arrays, or even regular expressions.
