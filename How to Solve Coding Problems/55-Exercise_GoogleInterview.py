Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&ab_channel=LifeatGoogle

It is a Google interview for a Software Engineer problem.
When you watchi this, it's going to be really, really hard to follow the actual coding, maybe some of the languages
that they use. But that's not the point. The point for you here is to watch the video, but also read the step by step
through a problem and see how the interviewee works on the problem.

In this case in that video follows the steps on the "Step By Step through a problem" section on your cheatsheet PDF.
And those steps are what you're going to do when you solve a problem in a coding interview. The fun thing is that at
the end of this course, we're going to revisit the video, and you're going to notice a difference from this very first
time that you're going to watch the video to the very end where what the interviewee does becomes second nature.

You understand what they're coding in, what they're doing to solve the problem and all these little steps. So that
you succeed if you completely get this video, and you understand how to run a successful interview at a company like
Google, or any large company, or maybe even startup, depending on what you like.
