Analytic Skills - how can you think through a problem and analyze things? When you're coding during an interview, they
                  want to hear your thought process and how you go from not knowing the answer to solving the problem.

Coding Skills - do you code well? Is your code clean, well organized, readable?

Technical Skills - do you know the fundamentals? did you just memorize things or do you understand the pros and cons of
                   different solutions?

Communication Skills - does your personality matches the company's personality? Can you communicate well with other
                       with a team? Most likely, you won't be working by yourself. You're working with others, with
                       other teams, with bosses, with managers. And they want to know whether you're the type of person
                       that's going to fit well and work well within the company.
