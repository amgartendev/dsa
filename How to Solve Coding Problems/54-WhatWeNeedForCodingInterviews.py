"""
In order to solve coding problems, we need to learn these data structures and these algorithms:

Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Algorithms:
- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion

There are a lot more of data structures and algorithms to learn, but let's focus what really matters for now.
