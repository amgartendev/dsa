Why do you think Linked Lists may be better than Hash Tables or arrays? Just from what we know right now.

My Answer: I think Linked Lists may be better than Hash Tables or arrays because we can keep track of our
items more easily. But one of its cons is that we need to iterate over N items if we want to add or remove
a new value from our Linked List.
